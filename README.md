# Open Skills

Intelligent skill manager for AI-assisted development environments. Discover, visualize, and synchronize `SKILL.md` files across your workspace seamlessly.

## Features

- **Workspace Scanning:** Automatically detects `SKILL.md` files in typical AI assistant directories (`.agent/skills`, `.cursor/rules`, custom paths).
- **Gap Analysis:** Visually compare the skills active in your current project against your available library.
- **One-Click Imports:** Missing a critical skill? Import it directly from the UI or via code hovers.
- **Native VS Code UI:** Integrated using standard VS Code Sidebars, Tree Views, QuickPicks, and Status Bars.
- **Works with Forks:** Fully compatible with Cursor, VSCodium, and VS Code Insiders.

## Getting Started

1. Open the **Open Skills** view from the Activity Bar (left menu).
2. Click **Rescan Workspace** to detect local skills.
3. Configure your import and scan paths in **Settings**.

## Developer Notes

This extension handles reading and mapping your AI context files into an easy-to-use directory structure without locking you into a specific IDE or platform.
